# pushbutton
**Simplified form using the on-off button**\
1.At first, you need to connect a simple circuit like this:

- As we can see above, the LED is connected to the digital port of the Arduino UNO board in port No. 13
- The on/off button is connected to the digital port No. 2

2.second, step is to write the Arduino code on the Arduino IDE:

Now after connecting the Arduino to your device, when the button is pressed, the LED will work will be `ON`

When you press the button again, it will be closed `OFF`
